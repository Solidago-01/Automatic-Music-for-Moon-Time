Automatic Music for Moon Time (2024) is a composition by L Autumn Gnadinger 
of procedurally generated sound via Pure Data meant to play at any desired length. 
The patch mix can also be adjusted in the UI. 

The parent patch must be launched in the same directory as the two child patches
(abstractions) to play successfully. Ensure your DSP is enabled and that your 
desired audio output is selected in the settings. 

Intended for use with PD Vanilla. Pure Data is developed by 
Miller Puckette since 1996.
